# casecontrolandr2
R code to make the figures in Paye &amp; Edge "Mathematical bounds on $r^2$ and the effect size in case-control genome-wide association studies." Running "figure1.R" produces figure 1, and running "sims_casecontrol.R" produces the remaining figures. Plots were produced in R version 4.1.2.
